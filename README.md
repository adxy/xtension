## X/Twitter Feed Video Blocker

Hide videos in the X/Twitter feed behind a click-to-reveal overlay while keeping tweet text visible.

### Install (Chromium browsers)
- Open `chrome://extensions` (or your Chromium-based browser's extensions page)
- Enable "Developer mode"
- Click "Load unpacked" and select this folder (`xtension`)

### Use
- Visit `x.com` or `twitter.com`
- Videos in the feed will be hidden behind an overlay
- Click "View video" on the overlay to reveal/play that video

### Notes
- No data leaves your browser; there are no network requests
- Targets: `x.com`, `twitter.com`, and their subdomains
- Files: `manifest.json` (MV3), `content.js` (logic), `content.css` (overlay/styles)
